Vote-Amercia
============

SMS voting app built for the #ElectionClass primary election.

Uses PHP, Twilio, and a little magic.

--------

Users are verified by "netid", which have been stored in a users table. 

* The first time a user votes, their phone number is tied to their profile

* If a phone number is already set in their profile, all future votes must come from that number

Once authenticated, an anonymous vote for the candidate is recorded in the votes table.

* An entry is also placed in the log table, noting the election the user voted in.
  
* Users can only vote once in each election
